# Playing with Terraform (September 2016)

- [VPC] gives me headaches (multiple). Clearly my brains is not good enough for so much complexity. 
That's why I need to study it again and again to try and get some sort of insight.
It would help if it was something I did at work but no chance, that's architect level stuff.

- While following a very interesting [VPC tutorial]() on Safaribooks online, I decided to use Terraform to build the examples used in the tutorial, so I'd be learning Terraform and VPC at the same time.

- Or perhaps I am kidding myself and by trying to learn two things, I won't learn a single one. Quite typical for me...
