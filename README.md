# Playing with Terraform (September 2016)

- [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/) gives me multipel headaches. Clearly my brains is not good/big enough for so much complexity. 
That's why I need to study it again and again to try and get some sort of insight.
It would help if it was something I did at work but no chance, that's "architect" level stuff.

- While following a very interesting VPC tutorial (Amazon Web Services - Virtual Private Cloud by Jon Gallagher, Published by Infinite Skills, 2015) on Safaribooks online, I decided to use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to build the examples used in the tutorial, so I'd be learning Terraform and VPC at the same time.
